- Object-oriented design and implementation
- GUI interface
- UML diagrams and system architecture design
- Sprint-based development with documentation

## Technologies Used
- Java
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git & GitHub
- Draw.io (for UML diagrams)
- Ubuntu/Linux development environment

## Development Approach
The project followed a structured sprint process. System design was completed before implementation, including UML diagrams and GUI wireframes. The source code is organized using object-oriented programming principles.
